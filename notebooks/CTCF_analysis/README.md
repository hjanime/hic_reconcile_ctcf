# CTCF sites analysis

- [CTCF analysis](./CTCF_analysis.ipynb): mapping Chip-Seq signals and Motif Scores on CTCF binding sites
- [CTCF clustering](./CTCF_clustering.ipynb): spatial clustering of CTCF binding sites and statistical assessment
- [CTCF genome coverage](./CTCF_genome_coverage.ipynb): we look at how genomic features are disposed inside biplets of CTCF binding sites: genes, TAD bounadries, TSS, TTS.
- [CTCF looping simulations](./CTCF_looping_simulations.ipynb): we simulate loop extrusion starting from CTCF binding motif orientation and permeability
